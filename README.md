# Cygnus
Operation Cygnus X-1 is a fun open world space themed game set in the distant future, where the player goes on a journey to explore the depths of our galaxy in search of a super massive blackhole called Cygnus X-1 which is said to contain the answers to the mysteries of cosmos. On this mission, the player comes across many heavenly objects, both familiar and unfamiliar, and learns some interesting facts about them! Although the hope of the mission is to travel all the way to Cygnus X-1, any information acquired by discovering new planets will help in the research. The mission ends when the player successfully returns to base after exploring their heartâ€™s content!
